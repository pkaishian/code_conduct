## **Code of Conduct: _Short Synopsis_**

_This Short Synopsis is intended to summarize the Code of Conduct for easy reference and understanding; it is not intended to replace the full Code. Words in **bold** in this Synopsis are specific references to items and ideas that are dealt with in detail in the full Code._ 


### Key Principles 

This Code is precedent upon three key principles, from which all else follows. These are:

1. **Truth:** we are scientists, so we strive for honesty in our research and our interpersonal interactions.
2. **Respect:** we are all human beings, so we readily offer respect, and expect it in return.
3. **Inclusion:** we are professionals, so we value and promote diversity and inclusion.


### Commitments & Challenges

We are committed to **represent the project professionally** at all times, to **act with integrity**, to **respect everyone** we come into contact with, and to **wholeheartedly accept the full diversity of the group**, while **rejecting discrimination, harassment, bigotry**, and any other conduct contrary to our key principles. Field work challenges include **remote, physically and mentally taxing conditions**, the potentially constant and **close proximity to our crewmates**, the fluid and sometimes nonexistent **boundaries between work and personal life**, the potential **lack of any personal space**, and the **previous histories we each bring** to the research endeavor. By honoring our commitments as a team, we can more effectively overcome these challenges. 


### Prohibited Conduct

We will not tolerate **any form of harassment** (see _Definitions_ section), **coercion, threatening, abusive or disrespectful behavior,** or **sexual misconduct**. There will be **no alcohol or other drug use permitted** while conducting field work, even when legally permissible. Additionally, it is prohibited to **obstruct or disrupt research and living conditions**, to **possess or use a gun** or other weapon (unless expressly permitted), to **physically or verbally abuse another person**, to **damage or steal property**, or to **incite others to do any of these things**. 


### Important Policies

This list is _non-exhaustive_ but covers the most important parts. Please read the full Code.

1. Project leadership will provide a clear **organization chart** specifying hierarchical relationships.
2. **Treat everyone with respect and dignity**, including respecting race, ethnicity, and gender identity.
3. Any **human subjects research **must be approved by an Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) approved Institutional Review Board (IRB) in the US, or equivalent.
4. Respect **local laws **(including **permitting requirements**), and **treat fairly** everyone helping with the research, including with **fair compensation **and** recognition **of their contributions. 
5. Communicate about the project **openly and honestly**. 
6. Sexual misconduct and sexual/gender-based harassment will be dealt with in a way that is **victim-directed**, focused on **offender behavior**, and ensures **fair process** for everyone involved. 
7. **New relationships are prohibited** during the course of field work to avoid conflicts of interest. 
8. Conflicts of interest, including **existing intimate relationships**, must be disclosed ahead of time.
9. If a violation is reported, **only the person with authority/power** is subject to punishment to protect victims in coercive relationships.


### Reporting Violations 

Because we are an inter-institutional group, there is not a single governing body to deal with concerns. We address this by **designating at least two Field Ethics Officers**, who are responsible for fielding reports of potential violations, and making sure everyone understands this Code. **Any suspected violations of this policy should be reported to one of the Field Ethics Officers.** Additionally, we have an **Ethics Partner Institution**, whose policies and code of conduct we all agree to be bound by, where this Code does not provide clear direction. Those are: 


    Field Ethics Officers:_________________________________________________________________ _________________________________________________________________________________ _________________________________________________________________________________


    Ethics Partner Institution: _____________________________________________________________

Any type of **retaliation for reporting**, or participating in an investigation, is strictly forbidden. 


### Reporting to Partner Organizations 

The Field Ethics Officers will be familiar with **funding and other partner organizationsâ€™ reporting requirements** for potential or actual violations of conduct standards, and will promptly report such violations as required. The Field Ethics Officers will be responsible for taking direction from these organizations in the event of an outside investigation. 


### Investigation Process

When a concern is reported, an investigation will take place to resolve the matter consistent with applicable laws while demonstrating respect for everyone involved, and **maintaining anonymity of all parties** whenever possible. The Field Ethics Officers will be responsible for conducting a thorough, objective investigation if one of the institutions sponsoring the field work does not take the lead on conducting the investigation. Unless otherwise directed by a sponsoring institution, the Field Ethics Officers will **be responsible for determining the facts of the case** through interviews and preparation of an objective, written report. 


### Outcomes and Sanctions

Outcomes of any investigation will be directed towards implementing solutions based on the findings of the investigation, with the goal of **minimizing the potential reoccurrence** of any conduct violations. **Sanctions** can include everything from **official reprimand** up to **removal from the project** entirely and **prohibition from future collaboration**. There are a variety of additional actions that may be necessary and appropriate in furtherance of the objectives and intentions of this Code. The Field Ethics Officers may remove a team member from the project during an investigation, as they deem necessary.
