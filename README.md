# **What is this document?**

**This document is a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/pkaishian/code_conduct/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md) intended to provide groups of researchers coming from a wide range of institutions a common framework supporting ethical and respectful conduct while working together in the field.** Field work organized across institutions may include participants from different backgrounds, even participants who are not affiliated with any particular institution, and are often funded from multiple sources. All of this may lead to ambiguity in, or outright lack of, any unifying Code of Conduct guiding such groups of researchers during their field work. 

We believe it is with the best of intentions that inter-disciplinary and inter-institutional researchers plan field work, expecting friendship and mutual respect to be sufficient for conflict resolution. While admirable in sentiment, this often-unconscious reliance on unspoken expectations may put the entire project at risk. Misconduct by even a single group member may result in serious safety, research, reputational, financial, and even legal consequences. By ensuring in advance of field work that there is a common understanding and expectation of accountability for ethical and respectful conduct in the field, this risk is greatly reduced. This Code of Conduct was created so that field work research groups might avoid conduct issues.

To that end, we provide several parts to this document: this [**Preamble**](https://github.com/pkaishian/code_conduct/blob/main/README.md), which provides context and instruction for using the Code; a [**Short Synopsis**](https://github.com/pkaishian/code_conduct/blob/main/short-synopsis.md), which summarizes the full Code in a convenient format for easy reference; and the full [**Code of Conduct**](https://github.com/pkaishian/code_conduct/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md) itself, which provides a great wealth of detail, including a structure to address concerns and violations. We also provide [**Additional Resourses**](https://github.com/pkaishian/code_conduct/blob/main/additional-resources.md) which the user may find helpful.

**This Code of Conduct specifically addresses:**

1. Key principles, commitments, and challenges (as well as potential solutions) to unify researchers from multiple institutions; 
2. Types of prohibited conduct; 
3. Definitions of key concepts; 
4. Specific policies for research ethics, diversity concerns, sexual and other forms of harassment and misconduct, and conflicts of interest; and
5. A structure to address concerns effectively, which recognizes the intersectionality of power and privilege, and includes guidelines on appropriate response, including the possibility of removing a member from the team.

One of the greatest challenges of inter-institutional field work is the potential lack of a single central organizing institution to provide clear policies and organizational structures. The lack of such a central authority is often only felt in difficult circumstances, such as when a conduct violation is reported. For this reason, we provide in this Code a structure for teams in the field to address such concerns, in which at least two Field Ethics Officers will be designated to address concerns and create a clear reporting structure, and an Ethics Partner Institution will be selected, to provide an unambiguous institutional authority (_e.g._, in the case when an investigation is necessary). 


# **How can this document be used?**

**We offer this Code not as a prescriptive norm, but as a framework to be modified, built upon, and improved based on the needs of particular field research projects and their team members.** We endeavored to write it in a way that is broadly applicable, so that it may serve as an effective tool to coalesce a shared understanding of ethical and appropriate conduct guiding a field research project. This is intended to be a living document that grows and evolves over time.

During the planning stages of any inter-institutional field work, the leadership of the project should carefully consider conduct and ethical issues, including issues related to interpersonal and cross-cultural interactions. What problems and misunderstandings might arise? How will they be dealt with, if they do? Most importantly, what expectations for respectful conduct are needed in order to minimize the possibility that these issues will arise in the first place? 

It [has been demonstrated](https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/aman.12929) that the provision of clear rules of professional conduct, as well as the training of group members in those rules, is an effective means of preventing conduct issues from arising (Nelson et al 2017). **When a code is adopted, all group members should be trained in its contents, personally committed to following it, and it should be consistently and visibly enforced by the project leadership.** Importantly, all team members need to acknowledge that they accept and will conform to the Code of Conduct before they are permitted to participate in a project’s field work. We recommend having each group member physically sign that they agree to the terms of whatever Code is adopted, ideally after an in-depth discussion, to ensure that they are aware of, understand, and commit to following the particular policies and guidelines established by the Code. 

In addition to the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/pkaishian/code_conduct/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md), we also provide a [Short Synopsis](https://github.com/pkaishian/code_conduct/blob/main/short-synopsis.md) that can be printed on a single page and used as a handout to ensure that every team member has the necessary information, and acknowledges their commitment to follow the standards established by the project leaders. 

Any group interested in using this document should carefully consider the _entire_ document, and modify it to fit the needs of the particular research project, field context, and group. There are, however, certain key points that must be carefully considered, and to which we would advise research groups to pay careful attention


1. It may be useful to explicitly define the start and end dates of the project or field work experience governed by this code, and ensure all participants acknowledge them.

2. The selection of the [**Field Ethics Officers**](https://github.com/pkaishian/code_conduct/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md#reporting-potential-violations--addressing-concerns) should be approached with care and deliberation. We provide some guidelines for selecting Field Ethics Officers, but project leadership should do everything they can to ensure that at least two people are designated who have as little overlap as possible in spheres of influence, social networks, privilege, identity, and status. It is best if they are also of different gender identities. The less overlap between the different Field Ethics Officers, the better the chances that someone needing to make a report will feel comfortable talking to (at least) one of them. Ideally, it would be possible for any member of the crew to report a conduct violation to a Field Ethics Officer without any conflicts of interest related to the alleged offender, or any social/cultural factors existing that might prevent a free report. We recognize that this may be impossible, therefore forethought and care should be put into the selection of the Field Ethics Officers to minimize potential conflicts of interest and other barriers to reporting.

3. The **Ethics Partner Institution** should also be selected with care and deliberation. It should be an institution that is sufficiently central to the field work and invested in the research, such that the institution is willing to devote resources to resolution of conduct issues and has direct institutional authority over a significant portion of the field crew. **Be sure to discuss the adaptation of this Code with the relevant administrative officers and authorities at your Ethics Partner Institution before finalizing the decision.** The Ethics Partner Institution will only be able to function in that role if they are aware of and agree to fulfill those obligations. It may be useful to have your selected Field Ethics Officers meet with the Title IX coordinator or equivalent for the Ethics Partner Institution before field work commences. It is also worth making explicit with the Ethics Partner Institution that **the adopted Code of Conduct should take precedence over the policies of the Ethics Partner Institution**, since it is the Code to which all members shall explicitly agree. This is stated in the section [_Reporting Potential Violations & Addressing Concerns_](https://github.com/pkaishian/code_conduct/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md#reporting-potential-violations--addressing-concerns), part 3, “Designation of Ethics Partner Institution”.

4. You should **provide appropriate training for your Field Ethics Officers**. We recognize that required and available training and related resources vary wildly across institutions, and that different research projects will have different access to potential training resources for their Ethics Officers. **We strongly recommend that you set aside sufficient funds from your project budget to provide professional research ethics training to these key team members**; this is an essential budget item in our view. We have provided links to several research ethics and conduct training resources in the [_Additional Resourses_](https://github.com/pkaishian/code_conduct/blob/main/additional-resources.md) section. Your chosen Ethics Partner Institution or another participating institution may be able to provide the appropriate training, as well. 

5. The [**Key Principles**](https://github.com/pkaishian/code_conduct/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md#key-principles), [**Commitments**](https://github.com/pkaishian/code_conduct/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md#commitments), and [**Challenges**](https://github.com/pkaishian/code_conduct/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md#challenges) sections provide the ethical basis for everything that is to follow, and should be considered carefully when any project is adapting this Code. We recommend caution in modifying these sections, because it is easy for unconscious biases and unexamined assumptions to creep into broad statements of purpose and principles. A statement of principles that is inadvertently exclusionary will leave group members feeling demoralized and excluded before the field work even begins. This may destabilize your research group, rather than unite it, as is essential for the project.

6. In the [**Prohibited Conduct**](https://github.com/pkaishian/code_conduct/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md#prohibited-conduct) section, we have made the decision to explicitly ban alcohol consumption. Even when permitted by law, the consumption of alcohol can be detrimental to the productivity of field work activities, which are generally of a short enough duration that abstinence should not be impossible for any group member (and if it is impossible, perhaps they should seek treatment). Alcohol consumption adds unnecessary complications to project planning and leadership, and an unnecessary additional contributing factor to conduct violations. Additionally, alcohol consumption may contribute to avoidable health and safety risks in remote research sites, where hazards are common and medical evacuation may be difficult and costly. 

    Some may find this to be overly strict or unnecessary (depending on the nature, duration and location of the field work involved), and desire to change it to something more permissive (e.g., alcohol prohibited during certain hours, or tasks, etc.). If that is so, we would urge caution, and careful consideration as to how altering this policy may affect compliance with expectations for ethical and respectful conduct. 


    In particular, you may want to add [**Definitions**](https://github.com/pkaishian/code_conduct/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md#definitions) to clearly establish the limited times, places, and situations when alcohol consumption is allowable or prohibited, while making it abundantly clear that it is never acceptable for a team member to be unable to conduct themselves appropriately. We also suggest implementation of policy that **alcohol should never be purchased with project funds** (many institutions and funders already dis-allow this, but it will depend on the funding source and institution); this will help create a culture conducive of sobriety. Likewise, it may be wise to specify particular personnel who are not permitted to drink (such as team leaders, or anyone responsible for health and safety concerns). Local cultural practices around alcohol consumption should be considered when altering this policy, as well. You may also want to add clarity to other policies, such as Sexual Harassment and Misconduct, about the role that inebriation will play in judging misconduct, to make it clear consumption of alcohol is _never_ an excuse for disrespectful or inappropriate conduct. (Remember, _no one_ can consent if they are drunk.) 

7. In the [**Conflicts of Interest and Abuses of Power**](https://github.com/pkaishian/code_conduct/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md#conflicts-of-interest-and-abuses-of-power) section, we have made the decision to explicitly forbid the formation of new intimate relationships between members of the group, regardless of hierarchical relationships and other power dynamics between them. During field work settings, emotional and physical stresses are exaggerated, group members are often isolated for some length of time, social dynamics may be altered from typical academic settings. In the field, there is often both a relaxing of hierarchical relationships (e.g., students and supervisors may relate more as equals) concurrent with a narrowing of hierarchical structures (e.g., a student may have no other administrative authority than the mentor with whom they are in the field). Given these complicating factors, we have judged that field relationships are highly inadvisable, because consent and formal/informal hierarchical dynamics may be difficult to untangle, leading to conflicts of interest and potential abuses of power.


# Who drafted this document? 

This document was prepared by a group of researchers who, while engaged in inter-institutional field work in a remote setting, had need of, and did not have, a Code of Conduct, nor clear guidance for dealing with conduct issues while participating in field work. The authors experienced several challenging interpersonal situations in that context. These cases — which involved sexual and gender-based harassment, abuse of power, and substance abuse — left the victims feeling unsupported by the Principal Investigators of the expedition. We recognize that, at the time, the expedition leadership did not act sufficiently to prevent or adequately address the harmful behavior of multiple group members. We also recognize that these conflicts might have been avoided, or been more easily addressed, had there been a Code of Conduct in place to catalyze a common understanding of and commitment to ethical and respectful conduct during field work. This Code of Conduct was created by both the victims, concerned parties, and the expedition leadership, so that other research groups might avoid conduct issues in similar field work settings. We are (alphabetically): Paulette Goyes, Jessica Grant, Patricia Kaishian, Tobias Policha, Daniel C. Thomas, and Roo Vandegrift. The Principal Investigators of the expedition were Tobias Policha, Daniel C. Thomas, and Roo Vandegrift.
