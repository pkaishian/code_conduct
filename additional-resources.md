# Additional resources:

_This Code of Conduct was prepared with reference to a large number of other resources, including publicly available codes of conduct and ethics for various academic, non-profit, governmental, and other institutions; published research on conduct issues, and available training resources for conduct and ethical issues in research and education. We provide here a list of resources we have found valuable in the creation of this Code, in the hopes that others may also find them useful._

## Other Codes of Conduct and Policies for Reference

The University of Oregon has [policies](https://policies.uoregon.edu/) that are thorough and well documented, as well as a [Student Conduct Code](https://policies.uoregon.edu/vol-3-administration-student-affairs/ch-1-conduct/student-conduct-code) that is detailed and relatively clear. There is also a [useful summary](https://dfkpq46c1l9o7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2003/02/Oregon-Affirmative-Action-Booklet-13-14.pdf) of some relevant policies created by their Office of Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity.

The National Geographic Society has a [Code of Ethics](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/ethics/) that may be particularly well suited to this sort of work, including a section on Professional Conduct that is covered in their [Nondiscrimination and Anti-Harassment policy](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FnOZY6Eha9zAw8rZgAjsyFCwnlHw9epU/view?usp=sharing). They also have an excellent [Authorship & Acknowledgements policy](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ASlxL0o1f3M72DwXJEgGdHmLFrGtF5Bd/view?usp=sharing), which covers many relevant ethical issues.

The California Native Plant Society’s [Code of Ethics for Botanists](https://www.cnps.org/education/botanist-certification/code-ethics) is an excellent resource. 

The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has made their [Employee Responsibilities and Conduct](https://www.ethics.usda.gov/science/ethical-conduct/DR4070-735-001.pdf) policy public. 

The School for International Training Study Abroad program has made public their [entire set of policies](https://studyabroad.sit.edu/admitted-students/policies/), including sections on Harassment and Research Ethics. 

The Transgender Law Center provides [sample policies](https://transgenderlawcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/model-workplace-employment-policy-Updated.pdf) for companies and organizations to draw from when crafting policies and codes of behavior that are inclusive of the transgender community.

Syracuse University makes their [Student Handbook](http://studentconduct.syr.edu/_documents/2019-20%20Student%20Handbook_all%20content%20changes.pdf) public, including sections on academic integrity, conduct, and sexual harassment, among other relevant topics.

The United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has published several useful [policy guidance documents](https://www.eeoc.gov/policy-guidance-documents-related-harassment) related to harassment. 


## Training Resources

**We highly recommend utilizing resources through the Ethics Partner Institution and other partner institutions to provide appropriate training to all crew members, and specifically to Field Ethics Officers.** Granting organizations that have reporting and conduct requirements will also typically provide resources for ethics and conduct trainings if requested. 

We provide here a selection of ethics- and conduct-focused training courses and materials, many of which have an academic focus. However, it should be noted that nearly all available research ethics courses are designed specifically with clinical research in mind, and may require adaptation for a field research context.

We specifically encourage project leadership to **ensure that Field Ethics Officers receive training** that specifically addresses such key topics as confidentiality, protected information, appropriate documentation, evaluation of emotional states and identification of needs based upon that evaluation, chains of reporting and reporting requirements and best practices, when to involve law enforcement, and the legal rights and responsibilities of involved parties, among other topics. 

It is important to **engage with institutional partners early in project planning**, and in presentation of and training in this Code in a manner that is appropriate to the project context. Engagement with the Ethics Partner Institution during planning stages will ensure that lines of communication and expectations are well established should there be any need for involvement by the Ethics Partner Institution in any situation. 

 

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) makes their [training materials](https://researchethics.od.nih.gov/CourseIndex.aspx) available online; it is rather dated and has a strong clinical focus, however. Similarly, [research ethics training materials](https://ori.hhs.gov/education/products/montana_round1/research_ethics.html) from the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is freely available online, though these materials also present a strong clinical focus, and appear not to have been updated since 2003.

The University of Oxford has made public an adaptation of a World Health Organization (WHO) [internal ethics course](https://globalhealthtrainingcentre.tghn.org/elearning/research-ethics/), though the site has been down for updates since March of 2020. The updated course will also likely have a strong clinical focus. 

The Training and Resources in Research Ethics Evaluation ([TRREE](https://elearning.trree.org/)) courses integrate local issues and perspectives from low- and middle-income countries, specifically from an African perspective. These courses also have a strong clinical focus.

Lastly, many academic institutions and government offices utilize the services of third-party, for-profit training services. It is possible to purchase training courses and materials through many of these, including [EVERFI](https://learn.everfi.com/cc-demo-workplace-training/), which is used by State University of New York (SUNY) College of Environmental Science and Forestry (ESF), and the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative ([CITI Program](https://about.citiprogram.org/en/homepage/)), which is used by “thousands of academic institutions, government agencies, and commercial organizations around the world”, including the University of Oregon. These training options are generally very expensive, and will not be tailored to the particular needs of the field research team, but access may be extended to the full research team if project leadership or the Ethics Partner Institution has access through institutional affiliation.
